NAME
    Test::RDF - Test RDF data for content, validity and equality

VERSION
    Version 0.20

SYNOPSIS
     use Test::RDF;

     is_valid_rdf $rdf_string, $syntax,  'RDF string is valid according to selected syntax';
     is_rdf       $rdf_string, $syntax1, $expected_rdf_string, $syntax2, 'The two strings have the same triples';
     isomorph_graphs $model, $expected_model, 'The two models have the same triples'
     has_subject($uri_string, $model, 'Subject URI is found');
     has_predicate($uri_string, $model, 'Predicate URI is found');
     has_object_uri($uri_string, $model, 'Object URI is found');
     has_literal($string, $language, $datatype, $model, 'Literal is found');

EXPORT
  is_valid_rdf
    Use to check if the input RDF string is valid in the chosen syntax

  is_rdf
    Use to check if the input RDF strings are isomorphic (i.e. the same)

  isomorph_graphs
    Use to check if the input RDF::Trine::Models have isomorphic graphs

  has_subject
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is a subject in any of
    the statements given in the model given as second argument.

  has_predicate
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is a predicate in any
    of the statements given in the model given as second argument.

  has_object_uri
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is a object in any of
    the statements given in the model given as second argument.

  has_literal
    Check if the string passed as first argument, with corresponding
    optional language and datatype as second and third respectively, is a
    literal in any of the statements given in the model given as fourth
    argument.

    language and datatype may not occur in the same statement, so the test
    fails if they are both set. If none are used, use "undef", like e.g.

     has_literal('A test', undef, undef, $model, 'Simple literal');

    A test for a typed literal may be done like

     has_literal('42', undef, 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer', $model, 'Just an integer');

    and a language literal like

     has_literal('This is a Another test', 'en', undef, $model, 'Language literal');

  has_uri
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is present in any of
    the statements given in the model given as second argument.
